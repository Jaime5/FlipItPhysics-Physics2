Equations for Constant Pressure:
- work =
  pressure * (final volume - initial volume)

- change in Temperature =
  specific heat of pressure * (final volume - initial volume)
  / (number of moles * R constant)

- heat energy =
  specific heat constant of pressure * number of moles * change in Temperature

Equations for Constant Volume:

- internalEnergyChange =
  heatEnergy =
  specific heat constant of volume * number of moles * change in temperature

- heatEnergy =
  specific heat constant of volume * volume * (final pressure - initial pressure) / R constant

Equations for Constant Temperature (Isothermal Processes):

- Pressure =
  number of moles * R constant * Temperature / Volume

- Work =
  number of moles * R Constant * Temperature * ln(Volume Final/Volume Initial)

The Carnot Efficiency Equation is defined by:
- Efficiency =
  1 - (Energy of the Cold Reservoir/ Energy of the Hot Reservoir)

The Actual Efficiency Equation is defined by:

- Efficiency <=
  1 - (Temperature of Hot Reservoir/Temperature of Cold Reservoir)

Equation for Power:
- Power =
  Work / Time

- Standard Metric System is Watts

- Watts =
  Joules / Second
