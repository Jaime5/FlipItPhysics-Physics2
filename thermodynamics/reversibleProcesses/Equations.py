Equations for the Coefficient of Performance:

Coefficient of Realistic Performance for a Refrigerator (heat flows out)
= heat of cold reservoir / work on engine
= 1 / ([heat of hot reservoir / heat of cold reservoir] - 1)

Coefficient of Maximum (Carnot) Performance of a Refrigerator
= 1 / ([temperature of heat reservoir / temperature of cold reservoir] - 1)

Coefficient of Realistic Performance for a Heat Pump (heat flows in)
= heat of hot reservoir / work on engine
= 1 / ( 1 - [heat of cold reservoir / heat of hot reservoir])

Coefficient of Maximum (Carnot) Performance for a Heat Pump
= 1 / (1 - [temperature of cold reservoir / temperature of hot reservoir])


Equations for Constant Pressure:

Work
  = pressure * change in volume
  = pressure * (final volume - initial volume)
