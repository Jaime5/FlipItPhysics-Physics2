An ideal gas in a piston is placed in a refrigerator,
which removes 512 J of energy from the gas via cooling.
The plunger on the piston is pushed down, which
does 115 J of work on the gas.

a. What is the net change in the internal energy of the gas in the piston?

Given the internal energy equation:
Internal Energy = Heat + Work

We know that the system (defined as gas) loses 512J of energy
and gains 115J of energy by having the piston perform work on it.


netInternalEnergy
= -512J + 115J
= -397J
