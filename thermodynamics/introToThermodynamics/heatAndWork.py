Imagine a system consisting of an ideal gas inside a piston

a. If we wanted to increase the internal energy of the system by 10 J, we could...

Using the equation of Internal Energy:

Internal Energy = Work + Heat

The first option gives us:

"Add 30 J by heating the system and have the system do 20 J of work."


30J of heat is added into the system through heating
The system itself does 20J of work, resulting in a loss of energy
The total difference if 10J

That is why option 1 is the answer
