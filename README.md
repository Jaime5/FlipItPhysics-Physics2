# FlipItPhysics: Answers for Thermodynamics, and Electrity & Magnetism

The answers to the thermodynamics section is difficult to
find, so I decided to provide my solution set and worked out
examples in python code. The bonus is that you can enter in
your values for numbers that are like your question and
obtain the same answer instantaneously. 

I've also included the list of PDFs that hold answers for 
Electricity and Magnetism since the old website that hosted 
them no longer does.

Good luck with Physics 2.
